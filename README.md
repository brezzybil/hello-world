# hello-world
Hello everyone, I'm a highschooler who's looking to learn some new stuff every day. 
I've recently gotten a bit of interest into coding, using Python to be exact. I think coding is quite fun and once you get hold of it you can achieve lots and lots of greatness. I'm 17, currently unsure of what I'll be pursuing as a career once I graduate. I think of life as going with the flow, you go along with wherever life takes you, I believe I will surely end up doing something I'll be happy with.
